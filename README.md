# ðŸŽ¾ Ball Bounce Simulation

This project is a simple 2D physics-based simulation built using **Pygame**, where multiple balls bounce around a window, reacting to collisions with screen boundaries. It visually demonstrates gravity and elastic collisions in a fun and interactive way.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Multiple balls rendered with image assets  
- Gravity-based vertical motion  
- Collision detection with screen boundaries  
- Custom background and ball images  
- Scalable screen and ball size settings  

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Pygame library  
- Random module  
- Custom image assets (background and balls)  

---

## ðŸ’¡ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
````

2. Run the simulation:

   ```bash
python ball_bounce.py   ```

3. Make sure the following image files are in the same directory:

   * `background-img.png`
   * `ball.png`

## ðŸ“š Learnings

This project helped reinforce the following concepts:

* Basic physics in game development (gravity, velocity, collision)
* Object-oriented programming in Python
* Handling images and screen updates using Pygame
